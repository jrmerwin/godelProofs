I'll analyze the data and create axioms based on the observed patterns and correlations. Here are 25 axioms across the 5 categories:

**RISK FACTOR AXIOMS**

```
Axiom 1: Financial Vulnerability Cascade

These axioms capture both direct relationships and more complex interactions in the student retention system, based on the data patterns and educational theory.
